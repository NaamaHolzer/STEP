      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I'm a 3rd year Software Engineering student specializing in Data Science.
          <br> In high school I realized I enjoy coding and therefore decided to persue a degree in Software Engineering.
          <br> Lately I've started an internship at Google. I'm excited to learn new things as well as implement what I've already learned. </p>
      <h2>Hobbies</h2>
      <p>On my free time, I enjoy reading books, drawing, cooking or just hanging out with my family or friends.
          <br> I also love listening to music (although I can't really play any instrument) and most of the time I have something playing in the background :) </p>
      <h2>My Family</h2>
      <p>I have two older sisters, one younger brother and a cat named Pisu (which is 'cat' in Malagasy, Thanks Guy :) ). We also have another cat who found us nice enough to adopt us as her family, her name is Karzi.
          <br>You can find pictures and more about my adorable cats in the gallery and in the next paragraphs. I'm sure you'll like them just as much as I do ;)
