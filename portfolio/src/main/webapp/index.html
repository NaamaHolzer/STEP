      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I'm a 3rd year Software Engineering student specializing in Data Science.
          <br> In high school I realized I enjoy coding and therefore decided to persue a degree in Software Engineering.
          <br> Lately I've started an internship at Google. I'm excited to learn new things as well as implement what I've already learned. </p>
      <h2>Hobbies</h2>
      <p>On my free time, I enjoy reading books, drawing, cooking or just hanging out with my family or friends.
          <br> I also love listening to music (although I can't really play any instrument) and most of the time I have something playing in the background :) </p>
      <h2>My Family</h2>
      <p>I have two older sisters, one younger brother and a cat named Pisu (which is 'cat' in Malagasy, Thanks Guy :) ). We also have another cat who found us nice enough to adopt us as her family, her name is Karzi.
          <br>You can find pictures of my adorable cats in the <a href="cats.html">gallery</a>. I'm sure you'll like them just as much as I do! </p>
      <h2>Projects</h2>
      <p>During my studies I've done a few projects. here are some of the interesting ones.</p>
      <ul>
          <li>Automatic Pet Feeder - this project focused on hardware and different sensors and motors.
              <br> The idea was to help disabled pet owners take care of their pets by letting the food bowl fill itself whenever it empties.<br>

          </li>
          <li>Vacation Booking System - in this project we created a system that lets hosting units owners offer their units to the public and lets people contact them and book a vacation based on their preferences.<br>

          </li>
          <li> A 3D Scene - in this project we implemented different Software Engineering principles like keeping the code healthy, testing it etc. We rendered a 3D image by creating classes for different geometries, light sources and more.<br>

      </ul>
